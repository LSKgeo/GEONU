# GEONU
Geoneutrinos are subatomic, fundamental particles that are produced by the radioactive -decay of Heat Producing Elements (HPEs) within the Earth’s interior. Geoscientists are particularly interested in the abundance and distribution of geoneutrinos produced by uranium (U), thorium (Th), and potassium (K) because they are long-lived radionuclides, preserving a record of Earth’s core-mantle thermal evolution.

This repository hosts the work-in-progress development environment for a user-friendly version of the code used to calculate geoneutrino flux. Each section of the .mlx main GEONU file contains description and explanation, and some also have interactive controls for changing model input values.

# Version
## v1_0
This version will run standard geoneutrino flux calculations to completion for one of six detectors (Borexino, KamLAND, SNO+, JUNO, CJPL, and Hawaii). The "Visualizing the Results" section is still a work-in-progress. The code has been mildly optimized but will incorporate more changes to its functions in the future. This version can run fewer than the recommended 10k Monte Carlo iterations due to the way one set of variables is preallocated. This will be fixed in update 1.1.

# UX Feedback Form
